# My code golfs

For those who don't know, code golf is trying to fit code into the least amount of characters. Usually in a code golf challenge the code has to do some defined minimal functionality, but here I add features as I go and try to put them into the least amount of characters (so versions of the same program most likely also differ in functionality and might be longer because of that).

I try specifically to minimise characters, not bytes.

I'm too lazy to write a web page for this now, so this README will do.
